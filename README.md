## <ins>Features</ins>

- All lists are curated and domains must have a robust explanation of why they are required, and why they break website functionality.
- No domains in 'whitelist.txt' may be used for Ad-blocking or tracking.
- New domains are added frequently.
- Lists can be easily imported as an 'allow list' with PiHole V6.
- Domains are categorized and are included in 3 different files (see below).
- If you are a beginner to Pi-Hole, adding these sites will solve issues with host files that block legitimate websites.
- Supported by Pi-Hole and Adguard Home

## <ins>Why do I need an allow list?</ins>

A community curated whitelist can be useful in situations where you run large blocklists above and beyond the standard lists. These may result in over-matching, and cause certain services (such as Google, Apple) to not work.

Furthermore, you may like to have a slightly more 'permissive' network and run either the optional or referral-sites list, such as if you have users on your network who might otherwise be frustrated by restrictive lists.

## <ins>What is your criteria for allowing items in the Whitelist?</ins>

While this is being refined, this is the current criteria:

1. The domain *must* break or reduce functionality of the website being visited.
2. In the main whitelist, no ad-tracking or telemetry domains are allowed.
3. The domain must have an age greater than 2 years.
4. The impact of blacklisting the domain is sufficient to warrant whitelisting. Minor impacts will not be considered.
5. There are no significant privacy, telemetry or ad-blocking impacts of whitelisting the domain.

## <ins>Installation (Pi-Hole v6)</ins>

1. Open your Pi-Hole Instance
2. Click on Lists
3. Enter in the link to the correct Whitelist (see below) into the Address box
4. Click 'Add Allowlist'
4. Update Gravity

## <ins>Overview</ins>
  <br />

| File Name | Domain Count | Description | Update Frequency | Raw Link |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| whitelist.txt | <!-- WHITELIST_COUNT -->194<!-- WHITELIST_COUNT_END --> | This file contain domains that are __safe__ to whitelist i.e. it does not contain any tracking or advertising sites. Adding this file fixes many problems like YouTube watch history, videos on news sites and so on. If you want to report additional domain feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/GoodnessJSON/PiHole-Whitelist/issues). | Occasionally | [link](../../raw/master/lists/whitelist.txt) |
| referral-sites.txt | <!-- REFERRAL_SITES_COUNT -->77<!-- REFERRAL_SITES_COUNT_END --> | People who use services like Slickdeals and Fatwallet needs a few sites (most of  them are either trackers or ads) to be whitelisted to work properly. This file contains some analytics and ad serving sites like __doubleclick.net__ and others. __If you don't know what these services are, stay away from this list.__ | Occasionally | [link](../../raw/master/lists/referral-sites.txt) |
| optional-list.txt | <!-- OPTIONAL_LIST_COUNT -->145<!-- OPTIONAL_LIST_COUNT_END --> | This file contain domains that are needed to be whitelisted depending on the service you use. It may contain some tracking site but sometimes it's necessary to add bad domains to make a few services to work. | Occasionally | [link](../../raw/master/lists/optional-list.txt) |

## <ins>How do I determine an ad domain?</ins>
- __Using PiHole:__ <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-determine-what-domain-an-ad-is-coming-from/1522">Follow the official Pi-Hole instructions</a> for identifying a problematic domain.
- __Adam:ONE Assistant (formerly DNSthingy Assistant):__ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adamone-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.
- __Using inbuilt Developer tool:__ For Chrome and Firefox, __`ctrl+shift+I`__ will land you in Developer tools menu.
- __Using an Android app:__ [__`Net Guard`__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard) is an Android app that can be used to monitor any specific apps, works on unrooted devices too.
